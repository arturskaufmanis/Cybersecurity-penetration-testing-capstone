# Cybersecurity-penetration-testing-capstone
A comprehensive cybersecurity capstone project demonstrating ethical hacking methodologies, vulnerability assessment techniques, and penetration testing skills using industry-standard tools. 


üîê Educational penetration testing assessment demonstrating cybersecurity skills and ethical hacking methodologies using industry-standard tools.

## Overview

This capstone project demonstrates a complete security assessment of the "Basic Pentesting 1" virtual machine. The project follows a structured 4-stage methodology to identify vulnerabilities and test security controls in a controlled educational environment.

## Objectives

- Conduct network reconnaissance and service discovery
- Identify security vulnerabilities through research
- Demonstrate controlled exploitation techniques
- Extract evidence and document findings professionally

## Tools Used

- **Kali Linux** - Penetration testing platform
- **VMware Workstation 17 Player** - Virtualization environment
- **Nmap** - Network scanning and service enumeration
- **Netdiscover** - Network host discovery
- **Metasploit Framework** - Vulnerability exploitation

## Assessment Methodology

### Stage 1: Network Discovery
- Network scanning and host identification
- Service enumeration and version detection
- Security threat assessment of running services

### Stage 2: Vulnerability Research
- Analysis of discovered services for security flaws
- Research of historical vulnerabilities (2010 timeframe)
- Identification of exploitable backdoor vulnerabilities

### Stage 3: Controlled Exploitation
- Configuration and execution of security exploits
- Achievement of elevated system access
- Verification of successful compromise

### Stage 4: Evidence Collection
- Extraction of system files as proof of access
- Documentation of compromised credentials
- Validation of unauthorized access capabilities

## Key Findings

- **Critical Vulnerability:** ProFTPD 1.3.3c backdoor (CVE-2010-4652)
- **Impact:** Complete system compromise with root access
- **Evidence:** Successful password file extraction
- **Proof of Concept:** Unauthorized login capability demonstrated

## Skills Demonstrated

- Network reconnaissance and enumeration
- Vulnerability research and analysis
- Security tool configuration and usage
- Exploitation technique implementation
- Professional documentation and reporting

## Educational Context

This project was completed as part of the HyperionDev Cybersecurity program capstone assessment. All testing was conducted in a controlled laboratory environment using designated vulnerable systems for educational purposes.

## Ethical Considerations

- Testing performed on authorized virtual machines only
- Educational and skill development focus
- Responsible security research practices
- No unauthorized access to production systems
